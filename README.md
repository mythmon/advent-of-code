# Advent of Code Solutions

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), a set
of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels
that can be solved in any programming language. A new set of puzzles is
released each year from December 1st until December 25th.

These solutions are often not my first attempt, and are usually edited after
fact. I usually refactor puzzles after they are solved, and re-work older
puzzles for performance, clarity, and cleverness. As I work on new puzzles
I'll sometimes factor out a helper or data type from a previous puzzle to
share them.

As well as the puzzle solutions, there is also a puzzle runner here, that can
run and verify and and all of the solutions. It has features that are helpful
to verify that my refactoring don't break anything, and also make solving the
puzzles easier and faster.
